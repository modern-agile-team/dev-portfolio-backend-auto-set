> This has been developed.

Open source that automatically builds [dev-portfolio](https://github.com/modern-agile-team/dev-portfolio)'s backend, such as API server and MySQL server.

</br>

It relies on [create-dev-portfolio](https://github.com/modern-agile-team/create-dev-portfolio) as a server for the dev-portfolio demo web. </br>
Therefore, the server can only operate through create-dev-portfolio
Please refer to the README.md of the repo.
